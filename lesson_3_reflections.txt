When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your work with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you want to share only working version of your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is a duplication of a repository, there is no relation between source
	and target.
	Clones is a local duplication of repository (for working). You can pull and
	push between the clone and the remote repository.
	Branches are a different commit path inside a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Like this you can incorporate in your local copy changes made in the remote.
	You can also perform a git log or git diff to see the changes. Then you can
	access it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git and GitHub, we should share our changes. It would be harder to 
	check the changes and to merge them. It would be easier to... have problems !

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Doing changes in a separate branch it's a way that other people can see exactly
	what changes you did before to merge them in the master. It's a way to keep 
	control on the master branch.
